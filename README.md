# Rust-Everywhere: Rust Programming Language Cross-Platform Development

This is still a WIP but the idea is to create a tiny RUST project that could be used cross-platform:

 - Android 
 - iOS
 - Desktop
 - Web
 - Backend

# TODO

 - Windows Support: At the time being building works for Linux and Mac.
